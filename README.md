Hi people,

I like website development, particularly the design componenet. I have had an interest in design from a young age. While I was young, I used to look at colours and fonts on brochures and advertisments and see how they work togehter. 

I'm not too strong with scripting, however I do enjoy lerning about it and partcipating in it.
